intel unveils laser breakthrough intel unveiled research mean data soon move around chip speed light scientist intel overcome fundamental problem now prevent silicon use generate amplify laser light breakthrough make easy interconnect data network chip process information intel researcher say product exploit breakthrough appear end decade overcome fundamental limit say dr mario paniccia director intels photonics technology lab write journal nature dr paniccia colleague haisheng rong richard jones ansheng liu oded cohen dani hak alexander fang show make continuous laser material use make computer processor currently say dr paniccia telecommunication equipment amplifies laser light travel fibre optic cable expensive exotic material gallium arsenide use make telecommunication firm chip maker prefer use silicon lightmoving element cheap many problem use highvolume manufacturing solve try take silicon competency manufacturing apply new area say dr paniccia work make component can move light around now silicon successfully use generate amplify laser light pulse use send data long distance despite fact silicon much amplifier light pulse form material use fibre optic cable improve amplification due crystalline structure silicon use make computer chip dr paniccia say structure silicon meant laser light pass collide photon rip electron atom within material creates cloud electron sit silicon absorbs light say intel researcher found way suck away errant electron turn silicon material can generate amplify laser light even laser light produce way can help easytomake filter tune across wide range frequency semiconductor laser make now produce light narrow frequency range result close integration fibre optic cable carry data light computer chip process dr paniccia say work one several step need silicon use make component carry process light form data pulse technical validation can work say
